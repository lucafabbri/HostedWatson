# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Concordia! We appreciate your help and support. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your contribution is as efficient and productive as possible.

## Code of Conduct

Our project is governed by the Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code in all your interactions with the community.

## Getting Started

### Reporting a Bug

*   Ensure the bug has not already been reported by searching the existing issues.
*   If you can't find it, open a new issue and include as many details as possible. Provide a clear title, a step-by-step description to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and the environment in which it occurred (operating system, .NET version, etc.).

### Proposing a New Feature

*   Open a new issue to discuss your idea. This allows us to discuss the proposal and decide if it aligns with the project's vision.
*   Provide a clear description of the feature, why you believe it's useful, and how it could be implemented.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1.  **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/lucafabbri/Concordia.git`
3.  Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug`.
4.  Make your changes and ensure the code adheres to the project's style and conventions.
5.  Write appropriate tests for your changes. Your PR will not be merged if it does not include adequate tests that show the code works as intended and doesn't introduce regressions.
6.  Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message. Commit messages should follow a format like: `feat: add feature X` or `fix: resolve bug Y`.
7.  Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.
8.  Open a Pull Request to the main Concordia repository, providing a clear title and description of the changes you've made.

## Code Conventions and Guidelines

*   Keep the code clean and formatted according to C# standards.
*   Use comments to explain complex parts of the code, but write self-documenting code whenever possible.
*   Ensure all changes compile correctly and all tests pass before submitting your PR.
*   Follow the existing code structure and organization.
*   If your changes include new dependencies, ensure they are necessary and documented.
*   Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
*   Review your code for any potential performance improvements or optimizations.
*   Ensure your code is compatible with the project's target .NET version.
*   If your changes introduce new public APIs, ensure they are documented in the code and any relevant documentation files.
*   If your changes introduce new features, consider adding examples or usage instructions in the documentation. Additionally, ensure that any new features are tested and documented in the project's README or other relevant documentation files.
